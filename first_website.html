    <div class="intro-text">Robin McLaurin Williams (July 21, 1951 – August 11, 2014) was an American actor and comedian. 
        Known for his improvisational skills[1][2] and the wide variety of characters he created on the spur of the moment and portrayed on film, 
        in dramas and comedies alike,[3][4] he is regarded as one of the best comedians of all time.[5][6][7] 
        Williams began performing stand-up comedy in San Francisco and Los Angeles during the mid-1970s,[8] and rose to fame playing the alien 
        Mork in the ABC sitcom Mork & Mindy (1978–1982).[9]

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="early-life"> Robin McLaurin Williams was born at St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, Illinois,[12] on July 21, 1951.[13] 
            His father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams, was a senior executive in Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division.[14][15] 
            His mother, Laurie McLaurin, was a former model from Jackson, Mississippi, whose great-grandfather was Mississippi 
            senator and governor Anselm J. McLaurin, a Democrat.[16] Williams had two elder half-brothers: paternal half-brother 
            Robert (also known as Todd)[17] and maternal half-brother McLaurin.[18] While his mother was a practitioner of 
            Christian Science, Williams was raised in his father's Episcopal faith.[19][20] During a television interview on 
            Inside the Actors Studio in 2001, Williams credited his mother as an important early influence on his humor, 
            and he tried to make her laugh to gain attention.[21]
